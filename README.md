**_This is Utility Project_** means those project which helps me to save time

## Project 1

### MNIST Number Recognition

#### Simple MNIST Neural Network from scratch

In this notebook, I implemented a simple two-layer neural network and trained it on the MNIST digit recognizer dataset. It's meant to be an instructional example, through which you can understand the underlying math of neural networks better.

## Project 2

### Logistic Regression

#### These are some practice Logistic Regression models

- **`Insurance_dataset.ipynb :-`** This model predicts whether a person of age 'N' will buy the Insurance or not.
- **`Load_Digits_Dataset.ipynb :-`** This uses inbuilt dataset of sklearn python library named 'load_digits'. This model predicts about the handwritten digit.
- **`Iris_Flower_Dataset.ipynb :-`** This uses inbuilt dataset of sklearn python library named load_iris. This model predicts about the type of flower by taking length of petal and sepal. It predicts whether flower is Setosa , Versicolor , Virginica
- **`HR_Dataset.ipynb :-`** This model predicts whether a person would leave the company or not by taking various parameters.

## Project 3

### MS Reward Point Collector

**_This is Utility Project_**

- In this, I have created a Python Script to automate the task of microsoft reward points.
- I have used Selenium web drivers to open a window in microsoft edge, then that window will wait for some second for manual account login.
- After login, it will automatically starts doing tranding searches in order to complete the task of collecting all the microsoft search points.
- After doing all the things, it will automatically close those windows.
- This project is capable of doint these things on multiple accounts at the same time, maximizing points collection in a small amount of time.

## Project 4

### YT Playlist Arranger

**_This is Utility Project_**

In this Projects I have created Python scripts that automates the process of renaming the downloaded videos of Youtube Playlist.

It is a kind of headache in my mind to rename all the videos according to their serial number, that's why I have created this.

- **`findTitle.py :-`** This script uses Selenium library to go to playlist link and get all the name/titles of the videos in playlist and stores them in a csv file named `video_title.csv` in the same directory.
- **`rename.py :-`** This script reads `video_title.csv` and get names of downloaded videos from the video directory given by user and smartly compares that with the title and add its serial number in the starting of the video name and save all the renamed videos in a seperate directory given by user.
- Use `findTitle.py` first to make the csv then `rename.py` to rename and move the videos accordingly.
