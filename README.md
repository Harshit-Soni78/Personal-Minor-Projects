## Project 1

### MNIST Number Recognition

#### Simple MNIST Neural Network from scratch

In this notebook, I implemented a simple two-layer neural network and trained it on the MNIST digit recognizer dataset. It's meant to be an instructional example, through which you can understand the underlying math of neural networks better.

## Project 2

### Logistic Regression

#### These are some practice Logistic Regression models

- **Insurance_dataset.ipynb :-** This model predicts whether a person of age 'N' will buy the Insurance or not.
- **Load_Digits_Dataset.ipynb :-** This uses inbuilt dataset of sklearn python library named 'load_digits'. This model predicts about the handwritten digit.
- **Iris_Flower_Dataset.ipynb :-** This uses inbuilt dataset of sklearn python library named load_iris. This model predicts about the type of flower by taking length of petal and sepal. It predicts whether flower is Setosa , Versicolor , Virginica
- **HR_Dataset.ipynb :-** This model predicts whether a person would leave the company or not by taking various parameters.
